                <li><b>1.1 Spend some time using the embedding projector to make and share observations about the MNIST data. Do the different digits separate into distinct clouds? Are there images that are in the wrong cloud, and can you make sense of why they are wrong? Are there images that are outliers from the rest of the data? Are there digits that seem more separate from the others, and are there pairs of digits that are more easily confused? Take notes on these and other observations that you make and write them up for your assignment.
                </b></li>
                <li>Different digits separate into distinct cloud. Some images are in the wrong cloud. Some 1’s are in with 6’s are some 6’s with 1’s. Similarly, the some 2’s that look like 7’s are with 7’s and vice versa. Some 1’s and 6’s look very similar, same with some 2’s and 7’s. There are not really any outliers from the data, but some 6’s and 8’s are way far away from their own respective clouds and towards the periphery of the entire dataset. 0’s, 2’s and 8’s seem to be more separate than others as well as from each other. 3’s, 4’s, 5’s and 7’s are more blended in with others as well as themselves. Also the 6’s have a very distinct clump, but some of them are confused as a 0 and others as a 1.</li>

                <li><b>1.3 Remember that this geometry is not based on any word definitions, but rather only the frequencies with which words co-occur in phrases. Also keep in mind that the vertical positions of the words are random, although you can specify these, too, by setting “up” and “down”. Experiment with various words to see if you can identify any insights about the data set. For example, try “politics” along the dimension from “bad” to “good”, or “engineer” along the spectrum from “man” to “woman”. Write up some notes on your observations, perhaps supplemented with a few pictures. Do you get different or better results if you use Word2Vec All instead of 10K? Did you find any interesting examples that speak to how words are used news articles? Write up what you experimented with and what conclusions you drew.</b></li>
                <li>I cannot really tell the difference between Word2Vec All and Word2Vec 10K. They are different but both seem equally good. I searched for words “gender” and “politics” and got list of words that are often used in news articles. I have attached some images that display that correlation.</li>

Record a few Font IDs for distinct characteristics/groupings that you find interesting (hover over a character to get its font ID), such as bold, italics, cursive...etc. You will use this in the homework.</b></li>

                <li>I let T-SNE run for 357 iterations. Everything collapsed into one line, so I could not see much groupings. However, if you look at the image below, you can that the fonts in the top part are distinctively different from the ones at the bottom.</li>
